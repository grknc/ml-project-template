## 1) Project Overview
House price prediction helps estimate the selling price of a property based on its characteristics. It supports buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals in making better pricing decisions.

## 2) Problem Definition
This is a regression problem. The goal is to predict a continuous value: the house price.

This problem matters because accurate pricing reduces risk for buyers and sellers. It can also support banks, agents, and investors in planning and decision-making.

## 3) Suggested Datasets
You can use public housing datasets from platforms like Kaggle.

Useful datasets usually include:
- Property size and number of rooms
- Location-related information
- House age and condition
- Final sale price

## 4) Recommended Models
Suitable regression models include:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge and Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor (like XGBoost or LightGBM)

You should also analyze feature importance to understand which variables influence price most.

## 5) Evaluation Metrics
For house price regression, use:
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): penalizes large errors more strongly
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error): easy to interpret average error size
- R2 (R-squared): shows how much variance in price is explained by the model

Using all three gives a balanced view of model performance.

## 6) Tools & Libraries
Recommended tools and libraries:
- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib / seaborn

## 7) Expected Deliverables
Your project outputs should include:
- EDA notebook
- Feature engineering
- At least 2 model experiments
- Model evaluation and comparison
- Business insights / conclusions
